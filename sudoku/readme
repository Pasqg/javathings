Small project that extracts and processes sudokus from photos, reads digit with a neural network and solves it.
The solver is basically an optimized search, nothing fancy. 
The detector identifies the grid of the sudoku, transforms it eliminating rotations, scaling and perspective distorsion.
The neural network identifies digits and is very simple (three layer convolutional network).
